This project work great I guess...

The client with serverless and nextjs work perfectly!

In the server, the `express-session` needs a database to store the sessions, the rest works great...

To use the api, only type `npm run build` or `yarn build` and it will create a `build` folder with the code in javascript, and now will use this code.
